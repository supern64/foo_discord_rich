This is a fork of foo_discord_rich, a component for the [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) audio player, which displays currently played track data via Discord Rich Presence.  

## Fork Changes
- elapsed time now uses Discord's new bar format
- able to display "top" or "middle" line in status (adjustable configuration)

## Note
This has only been tested on 64-bit fb2k. A 32-bit version is available but it isn't tested.  
I'm neither competent at C++ nor writing fb2k components, I am just modifying their work.
